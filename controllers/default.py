#### Intro

So, here we are trying to learn (and test) web2py's scheduler.

Actually you have to download latest trunk scheduler to make it work (backup current gluon/scheduler.py and replace with the one on trunk).

This app ships with a default SQLite database, feel free to test on your preferred db engine.

All examples code should work if you just prepend
``
import datetime
from gluon.contrib.simplejson import loads, dumps
sr = db.scheduler_run
sw = db.scheduler_worker
st = db.scheduler_task
``:python

DRY!

Additionally, every example uses ``task_name``, but that is not a required parameter.
It just helps **this app** to verify that all is working correctly when you press the **Verify** button.

We have 3 functions defined into models/scheduler.py (don't get confused). It should be something like this:
``
# coding: utf8
import time
from gluon.scheduler import Scheduler

def demo1(*args,**vars):
    print 'you passed args=%s and vars=%s' % (args, vars)
    return args[0]

def demo2():
    1/0

def demo3():
    time.sleep(15)
    print 1/0
    return None

def demo4():
    time.sleep(15)
    print "I'm printing something"
    return dict(a=1, b=2)

def demo5():
    time.sleep(15)
    print "I'm printing something"
    rtn = dict(a=1, b=2)


scheduler = Scheduler(db)
##or, alternatively :
#scheduler = Scheduler(db,
#                      dict(
#                        demo1=demo1,
#                        demo2=demo2,
#                        demo3=demo3,
#                        demo4=demo4,
#                        foo=demo5
#                        )
#                      )
``:python

So, we have:
 -  demo1 : standard function, with some printed output, returning the first arg
 -  demo2 : never returns, throws exception
 -  demo3 : sleeps for 15 seconds, tries to print something, throws exception
 -  demo4 : sleeps for 15 seconds, print something, returns a dictionary
 -  demo5 : sleeps for 15 seconds, print nothing, doesn't return anything
 -  demo6 : sleeps for 20 seconds, catches the sigterm signal

The scheduler istantiated with the db only. Optionally, you can pass a dictionary
containing a mapping between strings and functions.
In the latter case, all functions are "assigned" to a string that is the function name,
except for function demo5 that we "assigned" to 'foo'.

All interactions with scheduler is done acting on the scheduler_* tables.

### Scheduler

Worker fine management is hard. This module tries not to leave behind any platform
(Mac, Win, Linux) . Right now workers can be started with an "embedded" mode:

``web2py.py -K appname``

or "directly", using:

``python gluon/scheduler.py -u sqlite://storage.sqlite \
                             -f applications/myapp/databases/ \
                             -t mytasks.py``

When you start a worker, you may want later to:
 - kill it "no matter what its doing"
 - kill it only if its not processing tasks
 - put it to sleep
Maybe you have yet some tasks queued, and you want to save some resources.
You know you want them processed every hour, so, you'll want to:
 - process all queued tasks and die automatically
All of these things are possible managing ``Scheduler`` parameters or the ``scheduler_worker`` table.
To be more precise, for started workers you will change the ``status`` value of any worker to influence
its behaviour.
As tasks, workers can be in some fixed statuses : ACTIVE, DISABLED, TERMINATE or KILLED.

**ACTIVE** and **DISABLED** are "persistent", while **TERMINATE** or **KILL**, as statuses
name suggest, are more "commands" than real statuses.
Hitting ctrl+c is equal to set a worker to **KILL**

[[workers statuses http://yuml.me/bd891eed.jpg center]]
The complete signature of the scheduler class is
``
Scheduler(
    db,
    tasks=None,
    migrate=True,
    worker_name=None,
    group_names=None,
    heartbeat=HEARTBEAT,
    max_empty_runs=0,
    discard_results=False,
    utc_time=False
    )``:python
Let's see them in order:

``db`` is the database DAL instance were you want the scheduler tables be placed.
NB: If you're using SQLite it's best to create a separate db to avoid lockings

``tasks`` can be a dict. Must be defined for the "direct" mode or if you want to call a function
not by his name, i.e.
``tasks=(mynameddemo1=demo1)`` will let you execute function demo1 with
``st.insert(task_name='mytask', function_name='mynameddemo1')``
or
``st.insert(task_name='mytask', function_name='demo1')``
In "embedded" mode, if you don't pass this parameter, function will be searched in the app environment.

``worker_name`` is None by default. As soon as the worker is started, a worker name
is generated as hostname-uuid. If you want to specify that, be sure that it's unique.

``group_names`` is by default set to **[main]**. All tasks have a ``group_name`` parameter,
set to **main** by default.
Workers can pick up tasks of their assigned group.
NB: This is useful if you have different workers instances (e.g. on different machines)
and you want to assign tasks to a specific worker.
NB2: It's possible to assign a worker more groups, and they can be also all the same, as
``['mygroup','mygroup']``. Tasks will be distributed taking into consideration that
a worker with group_names ``['mygroup','mygroup']`` is able to process the double of the tasks
a worker with group_names ``['mygroup']`` is.

``heartbeat`` is by default set to 3 seconds. This parameter is the one controlling how often
a scheduler will check its status on the ``scheduler_worker`` table and see if there are any
**ASSIGNED** tasks to itself to process.

``max_empty_runs`` is 0 by default, that means that the worker will continue to process tasks
as soon as they are **ASSIGNED**. If you set this to a value of, let's say, 10, a worker
will die automatically if it's **ACTIVE** and no tasks are **ASSIGNED** to it for 10 loops.
A loop is when a worker searches for tasks, every 3 seconds (or the set ``heartbeat``)

``discard_results`` is False by default. If set to True, no scheduler_run records will be created.
NB: scheduler_run records will be created as before for **FAILED**, **TIMEOUT** and
**STOPPED** tasks's statuses.

``utc_time`` is False by default. If you need to coordinate with workers living in different
timezones, or don't have problems with solar/DST times, supplying datetimes from different countries,
etc, you can set this to True. The scheduler will honour the UTC time and work leaving the local
time aside. Caveat: you need to schedule tasks with UTC times (for start_time, stop_time, and so on.)
    """
    docs.tasks = """
### Tasks lifecycle

The ``scheduler_task`` table is the one where tasks are organized.

Task is going to be scheduled and several values will be auto-filled (we'll analyze
those later).

All tasks follow a lifecycle

[[scheduler tasks http://yuml.me/ce8edcc3.jpg center]]

Let's go with order. By default, when you send a task to the scheduler, you'll want
that to be executed. It's in **QUEUED** status.
If you need it to be executed later, use the ``start_time`` parameter (default = now).
If for some reason you need to be sure that the task don't
get executed after a certain point in time (maybe a request to a webservice
that shuts down at 1AM, a mail that needs to be sent not after the working hours,
etc...) you can set a ``stop_time`` (default = None) for it.
If your task is NOT picked up by a worker before stop_time, it will be set as
**EXPIRED**.
Tasks with no stop_time set or picked up **BEFORE** stop_time are **ASSIGNED**
to a worker. When a workers picks up them, they become **RUNNING**.
**RUNNING** tasks may end up:
 - **TIMEOUT** when more than n seconds passed with ``timeout`` parameter (default = 60 seconds)
 - **FAILED** when an exception is detected
 - **COMPLETED** when all went ok

Additionally, you can control how many times a task should be repeated (i.e. you
need to aggregate some data at specified intervals). To do so, set the ``repeats``
parameter (default = 1 time only, 0 = unlimited). You can influence how many seconds should pass between executions
with the ``period`` parameter (default = 60 seconds).
NB: the time is not calculated between the END of the first round and the START of the next, but
from the START time of the first round to the START time of the next cycle)

Another nice addition, you can set how many times the function can raise an exception (i.e.
requesting data from a sloooow webservice) and be queued again instead of stopping in **FAILED**
status with the parameter ``retry_failed`` (default = 0, -1 = unlimited).

[[task repeats http://yuml.me/cdd6ebe9.jpg center]]

Summary: you have
 - ``period`` and ``repeats`` to get an automatically rescheduled function
 - ``timeout`` to be sure that a function doesn't exceed a certain amount of time
 - ``retry_failed`` to control how many times the task can "fail"
 - ``start_time`` and ``stop_time`` to schedule a function in a restricted timeframe
